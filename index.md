The _Critical Decentralization Cluster_ (CDC) is a host of individuals and projects that come together to disrupt existing ecosystems with cypherpunk ideals. We assemble to present talks and workshops that critically discuss the future of decentralization. You can visit us during Dec 27-30 2025 in Hamburg (Germany) at the [39th Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress).

The CDC usually takes shape as an area in Hall H with:
* tables and seats for ca. 120 people
* 2 info tables and meeting spots
* 2 workshop areas with public schedule
* 1 recording area

Talks and workshops submissions are now open at [pretalx.riat.at](https://pretalx.riat.at/39c3/cfp).\
We welcome proposals from our assemblies and any other project fitting the cluster themes' (decentralization, privacy & anonymity and open hardware).
