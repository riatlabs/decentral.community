The _Critical Decentralisation Cluster_ (CDC) is a group of likeminded assemblies working together to present projects, talks and workshops that critically discuss the future of decentralisation. You can visit us during Dec 27-30 2025 in Hamburg (Germany) at the [39th Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress).

The CDC usually takes shape as an area in Hall H with:
* tables and seats for ca. 120 people
* 2 info tables and meeting spots
* 2 workshop areas with public schedule
* 1 recording area

Talks and workshops submissions are now open at [pretalx.riat.at](https://pretalx.riat.at/39c3/cfp).

We welcome proposals from our assemblies and any other project fitting the cluster themes' (decentralization, privacy & anonymity and open hardware).

# contributing

* **Volunteer work** is essential to keep the cluster going. Tasks range from
  "keeping our tables tidy" all the way to "operating the A/V setup". All
  assemblies should be proactive.
* **Financial support** enables us to build the tools we need. From
   the high tech recording setup down to low tech items such as furniture.
   Monero donations are welcomed: [8B5xvYLwUWsiwzNhBeZJkABRgPsYqsR3X8mHVWgphRqQVvM5khLYdfvgyZg2Rhub2uFnoSiVVKTgNKpvDUDVho2BQVyzEDC](monero:8B5xvYLwUWsiwzNhBeZJkABRgPsYqsR3X8mHVWgphRqQVvM5khLYdfvgyZg2Rhub2uFnoSiVVKTgNKpvDUDVho2BQVyzEDC?tx_description=CDC)
