# What is a cluster?

Clusters (in the terms of C3) are groupings of assemblies and provide the necessary infrastructure, space and context for specific experiences. In our case, we are proved an area for outreach and exchange in the categories Privacy & Anonymity, Coded Cultures and Open Hardware. The cluster was organised by RIAT and the Monero Community and made possible through a lot of voluntary work and support from individuals. Read our [mission statement](/mission).

# Talks and workshops

We had a recording stage, with slots for presentations and dedicated areas for workshops.
Proposals for both were accepted [in the frab system](https://frab.riat.at/en/35c3/cfp).

# What is the CCC / C3?

The [Chaos Computer Club](https://www.ccc.de/en/club) (CCC) is the largest (and oldest) hacker association in Europe and was [founded in 1981](https://berlin.ccc.de/~tim/tmp/tuwat-protokoll.pdf). Originating from Germany, it has spread over Europe and organizes numerous events, such as the annual [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress). The congress takes place between christmas and new years eve, [since 1984](https://events.ccc.de/congress/). It is considered one of the largest (over 15,000 attendees) events of this kind, alongside the [DEF CON](https://defcon.org) in Las Vegas.


This year ([35C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Assembly:Critical_Decentralisation_Cluster)) our cluster has been growing. Come and visit us!
