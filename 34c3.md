# History of RIAT and Monero at C3

Individual members of the assemblies are frequent visitors to the C3, some even since the last millennium.

In 2015 ([32C3](https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7355-apertus_axiom)) we have been at C3 with the [apertus AXIOM project](https://eu.axiom-camera.com).

In 2016 ([33C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Assembly:RIAT_Crypto_Lab)) the RIAT Crypto Assembly featured crypto-based workshops with Monero, and [Tomu 2FA devices](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Projects:Tomu). It was the initial (mini) implementation of Monero at C3. In this year the Bitcoin Assembly was the only other cryptocurrency assembly.

In 2017 (34C3) we organised an assembly for [Monero](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Assembly:Monero_Assembly) and for [RIAT](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Assembly:RIAT), so we could then have a combined RIAT/Monero/Bitcoin Village. The [Monero December](https://www.meetup.com/Monero-Austria/events/245306598/) meetup in Vienna served as a real-life meeting in order to prepare the [Monero Assembly](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Assembly:Monero_Assembly). Communication and organisation was via [hackpad](https://pads.ccc.de/Monero) and via [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7f8tke/monero_at_the_34c3_share_your_ideas_and_help_to/).
Besides the assembly, there were Monero-related talks presented to a large audience at the [ChaosWest self-organized stage](https://media.ccc.de/c/34C3-chaoswest).
