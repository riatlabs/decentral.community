# Call for Participation
The Internet landscape is evermore on it's steadfast course towards surveillance
and centralization. Video content and streaming out of CDNs now account for half
of all global traffic; splinternets are now a thing, from China to South Korea,
from Russia to Iran; mandatory backdoors on communication platforms are just
around the conner with EU's Chat Control.\
In this scenario, where most Internet connected devices have become tools
of imprisonment rather than liberation, reviving the old Internet ethos of
peer-to-peer (P2P) and private communication is of uttermost importance.

Taking a modest but nonetheless important step, we hereby come to announce the
revival of the [Decentralized Internet and Privacy
Devroom](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/decentralized-internet-and-privacy/)
at [FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/).\
This devroom welcomes talks from all technical projects and initiatives which
foster decentralization and privacy on the Internet, or try to replace it for
something new altogether. We also welcome those working on securing the
devices, operating systems and user-facing software we use to access The Net.

For those new to it, FOSDEM is an annual conference on free and open source
software, attended by over 8000 developers and enthusiasts from all over the
world. It takes place in Brussels (Belgium) at the [ULB (Campus
Solbosch)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1632534522). It is a
community-driven event and entry is free of charge.\
Beyond the main programme, FOSDEM supports dozens of devrooms, mini
conferences-within-a-conference, dedicated to discussing a specific theme.

In 2026 FOSDEM will happen on the weekend of January 31st and February 1st.
The Decentralized Internet and Privacy Devroom itself will run during the entire
day of Sunday, February 1 2026.

## Scope of Talks
Presentation topics may include:
- ad-hoc and mesh networks
- cryptography-based network stacks
- anonymous overlay networks
- community run ISPs and networks

- decentralized/federated network protocols and platforms
- cryptography-based network protocols (e.g. public key as identity)
- decentralized instant messaging, video/file sharing and content storage
- self-hosting and community-hosting solutions

- minimalistic browsers
- privacy preserving browsers and extensions
- privacy oriented operating systems

## Format
Talks are expected to be technical and no more than 20-25 min long. Total time
with Q&A and moderation should stay under 30 min.\
50 min long talks (plus 10 min for Q&A and moderation) may be accepted on an
exceptional basis, if the topic at hand brings enough novelty to warrant a deep
technical dive.\
Speakers may submit multiple talks.

## Requirements
All talks should be held in English.\
Talks as well as Q&As will be recorded and later published in the FOSDEM
website. They may be also livestreamed. By hosting a talk, you agree to the
