The decentral.community has the following aims:
* To critically discuss decentralisation in all its facets: thematising privacy vs. transparency, private cryptocurrency, headless organisations, immutable code, future (code) governance and open vs. libre technologies.
* To discuss open hardware, libre hardware and its limits.
* To provide a space for exchange and outreach in the context of privacy technologies.
* To foster interdisciplinary work and an inclusive practice to improve crypto-literacy as well as technological literacy.
* To advocate critical projects and initiatives in the context of decentralisation and to open them up to a larger audience of peers.

One dedicated aim of the community is to accumulate the necessary infrastructure
to organise the Critical Decentralization Cluster every year at C3, and to have
it available throughout the year for other events, presentations and
workshops.\
Initial donations have been made by XMR.TO and a few anonymous
individuals, hardware and equipment have been provided by RIAT.
