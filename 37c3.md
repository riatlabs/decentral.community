The Critical Decentralisation Cluster at the 37th Chaos Communication Congress (37C3) was an area and grouping of similar minded projects, which offered workshops and hosted a space to critically discuss the future of decentralization.

On 37C3 congress was back in Hamburg, and the cluster got located in the eastern corner of hall 3 on the ground floor ([c:0:135.5:159.25](https://37c3.c3nav.de/l/c:0:135.5:159.25/)).

We also organized a [recorded talks' session in Saal D](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/event/cdc-critical-decentralization-cluster-cluster-reco/).
