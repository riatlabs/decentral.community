The _Critical Decentralisation Cluster_ (CDC) is returning to the [39th Chaos
Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/infos/startpage.html)
in Hamburg (Germany) during Dec 27-30 2025. We bring together assemblies and
projects that challenge centralized infrastructures with decentralised,
privacy-preserving and open hardware approaches. Expect talks, workshops and
lots of hallway conversations around cypherpunk futures.

Planning for 39C3 is well underway. Follow the links below to stay in the loop,
propose sessions and coordinate with the cluster.

# sessions
The CDC has 2 workshop areas with public schedule. One of them equipped with a
mini-stage and recording equipment for short talks.\
We invite our assemblies and any other project fitting the cluster themes' to
join in and share their knowledge.

Submissions are open at [pretalx.riat.at](https://pretalx.riat.at/39c3/cfp)\

# location
The CDC usually takes shape as an area in Hall H with:
* tables and seats for ca. 120 people
* 2 info tables and meeting spots
* 2 workshop areas

# contributing
**Volunteer work** is essential to keep the cluster going.\
